    The AvdStructuredConfig Class is imported by "get_structured_config" to render parts of the structured config.

    "get_structured_config" imports, instantiates and run the .render() method on the class.
    .render() runs all class methods not starting with _ and of type @cached property and inserts the returned data into
    a dict with the name of the method as key. This means that each key in the final dict corresponds to a method.

    The Class uses AvdFacts, as the base class, to inherit the _hostvars, keys and other attributes.
    All other methods are included as "Mixins" to make the files more manageable.

    The order of the @cached_properties methods imported from Mixins will also control the order in the output.
