      If `true` (default) an MLAG ID will always be configured on a Port-Channel downlink even if the downlink is only on one node in the MLAG pair.
      If `false` an MLAG ID will only be configured on Port-Channel downlinks dual-homed to two MLAG switches.
      Note the default value will change to `false` in AVD version 5.0
    # TODO: AVD5.0 change default to false and remove the note from the description.
