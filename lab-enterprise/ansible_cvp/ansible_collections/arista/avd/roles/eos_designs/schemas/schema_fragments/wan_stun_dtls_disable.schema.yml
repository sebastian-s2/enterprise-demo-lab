    description: |-
      WAN STUN connections are authenticated and secured with DTLS by default.
      For CV Pathfinder deployments CloudVision will automatically deploy certificates on the devices.
      In case of AutoVPN the certificates must be deployed manually to all devices.

      For LAB environments this can be disabled, if there are no certificates available.
      This should NOT be disabled for a WAN network connected to the internet, since it will leave the STUN service exposed with no authentication.
